# Breakout
A prototype Breakout game made with SDL2.0

## Dependencies:

**SDL2-2.07:**

* SDL2.lib

* SDL2main.lib

* SDL2_image.lib

* SDL2_ttf.lib

* SDL2_mixer.lib

### Known Bugs/Shortcomings:
* Bottom right block being destroyed without getting hit
* Paddle physics only has 3 hit areas
* Ball physics very limited (no collider logic currently on the blocks so no direction change based on hit location)
